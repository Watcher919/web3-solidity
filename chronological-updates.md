## Lesson 5
### Windows & WSL
- Per [this question](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/discussions/34#discussioncomment-2846436), if you're using WSL, for the ganache UI you'll have to use a different endpoint. 

On the Ganache UI, you can select a different hostname and connect to whatever IP you see. In the example below, you'd connect to `172.24.224.1`

Or, optionally, you can install `ganache-cli` [as this user did](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/discussions/39#discussioncomment-2854165).
